# Yoga Studio
## Code Institute - User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project 

This site is currently published on the following link: [YogaStudio](https://jih22.github.io/yoga-class/)

The goal was to create a website for a private yoga teacher, this is a typical common 
website and very very simple. Itâ€™s very similar to the original project [WhiskeyDrop](https://github.com/jih22/bootstrap4).

 
## UX
 
- As a user, I want a mobile friendly website and responsive. 
- As a user, I want to easily navigate the site.
- As a user, I want to view the image gallery without having an issue.
- As a user, I want to follow/connect to the person thru social media.

* Courses allows the client to choose subscription. 
* Footer  - The "quick links"  social icon link and contact, book address and hours available.
* Contact & SignUp form (modal) - Basic layout taken from previous modules studied.

### Future Features

- In the future I would like to updated capabilities for all forms on this site, like animation, hover, transiton etc. 
- Put testimonials would all help explain the quality of the services to the user.
- Also I would like to add more features, online videos classes in the future.
- Payment functionality to process real credit cards.

### Known Issue
- For some reason the pages had some margin issue, so I wrote *"no-margin"* to all *"row"* and it works well. Thanks to my mentor!
- *required* html not working I tried to fix but no luck. 

## Technologies Used

* HTML - Used as the base for markup text.
* CSS - Used as the base for cascading styles.
* I used Bootstrap creating the navbar which is ensuring mobile-first design and responsive size display.
* The project also uses [BootstrapCDN](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/)to provide icons from [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to style the website fonts. 
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.
* [PopperJS](https://popper.js.org/) required for Bootstrap functionality.  

## Testing

* This website was constantly tested while development using Chrome dev tools. I used this to resize the browser to check new code was working, and different mobile/tablet screen sizes. 
* This website was tested on Windows desktop computer and on Android phones Samsung Galaxy S7 & s8, Samsung A70, Oppo F7. 
* Also tested in Safari browser. 

* The HTML code was validated using The W3C Markup Validation Service. Validation service noted that I have Unclosed element </div> and I got some Error & Warning about Duplicate ID name, so I checked any errors and sorted them if needed.
* The CSS code was validated using CSS validator The W3C CSS Validation Service. I got Error: "text-align: middle is not a text-align value".
